# GitHub Actions Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, building, and releases while maintaining your personal contribution graph.

## ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy: Manual Review for Clean Contribution Graph

Instead of making automated commits under your name, our workflows create **Pull Requests for review**. This approach:

- âœ… Keeps your contribution graph clean and authentic
- âœ… Ensures you review all changes before they're merged
- âœ… Maintains full control over what gets released
- âœ… Follows best practices for repository management
- âœ… Provides clear audit trail of all changes

## ðŸ”§ Required Setup

### 1. Repository Secrets

You need to configure these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

- `NPM_TOKEN` - For publishing to npm registry
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub (no setup needed)

### 2. Update Workflow Files

Replace `your-username` in the following files with your actual GitHub username:

- `.github/workflows/auto-assign.yml` (line 15 and 36)
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` (line 47)
- `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml` (line 32 and 55)

### 3. Repository Settings

Enable the following in your repository settings:

1. **Pull Requests** â†’ Enable "Allow auto-merge"
2. **Branches** â†’ Add branch protection rules for `main`:
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging

## ðŸ¤– How Automated Workflows Work

### Release Process

1. **Automatic Detection**: When you push to `main`, the system checks if a release is needed
2. **PR Creation**: If a release is needed, a PR is created with the proposed changes
3. **Review Request**: You're automatically requested to review the PR
4. **Manual Merge**: You review and merge the PR manually
5. **Release Execution**: The actual release happens after your merge

### Dependabot Updates

1. **PR Creation**: Dependabot creates PRs for dependency updates
2. **Analysis**: The system analyzes the update type (patch/minor/major)
3. **Review Request**: You're requested to review with context about the update
4. **Manual Decision**: You decide whether to merge based on the analysis

### Feature PRs

1. **Auto-Label**: PRs are automatically labeled based on changed files
2. **Review Request**: You're automatically requested to review
3. **Status Checks**: All tests and checks must pass
4. **Manual Merge**: You review and merge manually

## ðŸ“Š Benefits for Your Contribution Graph

- **Clean Graph**: Only your actual commits appear, not bot commits
- **Authentic Activity**: Shows your real development activity
- **Professional Profile**: Maintains the integrity of your GitHub profile
- **Control**: You decide what gets merged and when

## ðŸ›  Workflow Details

### CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)

- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, PRs to main
- **Tests**: Runs on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- **Checks**: Linting, type checking, tests, build
- **Release**: Creates PR for review instead of direct release

### Auto-assign (`.github/workflows/auto-assign.yml`)

- **Triggers**: New PRs opened
- **Actions**: Requests your review, adds labels
- **Benefits**: Ensures you see all PRs

### Dependabot Review (`.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`)

- **Triggers**: Dependabot PRs
- **Actions**: Analyzes update, requests review with context
- **Safety**: Major updates get special attention

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone and setup**: Follow the main README for project setup
2. **Update usernames**: Replace `your-username` in workflow files
3. **Configure secrets**: Add NPM_TOKEN in repository settings
4. **Test the workflows**: Create a test PR to verify everything works
5. **Enable branch protection**: Set up required reviews for main branch

## ðŸ”„ Typical Workflow

1. You make changes and push to a feature branch
2. Create a PR â†’ Auto-assign workflow requests your review
3. CI runs tests â†’ You review results
4. Merge PR â†’ Release workflow creates release PR if needed
5. Review release PR â†’ Merge to trigger actual release
6. Dependabot updates â†’ Review and merge dependency updates

## âš¡ Quick Commands

```bash
# Check workflow status
gh run list

# View specific workflow run
gh run view <run-id>

# Manually trigger release (if needed)
gh workflow run release

# Check pending PRs needing your review
gh pr list --review-requested=@me
```

This setup ensures you maintain full control while benefiting from automation!
